# Introduction to R

This course is based on the [welcome-to-the-tidyverse](https://github.com/rstudio-education/welcome-to-the-tidyverse) materials.

It's an introduction to working with data and visualizations in R. 
`Quarto` is introduced for reporting.

The language `R` can be used for many purposes, such as data wrangling and cleaning, visualizations, interactive reports, modelling, forecasting, and machine learning.
In this course, we'll focus on 

- basic data wrangling, 
- descriptive statistics, 
- data visualizations, and
- reporting.
